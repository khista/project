We'll define a super hero character using variables and values
Use the right data type for each variable

Variable name: fly, value: false
Variable name: hasBatmobile, value: true
Variable name: life, value: (value between 0 and 100)

Show each value using console.log() with the variable name (string) as first parameter and the actual variable value as second
Example: console.log('name', name);
Also show the variable names and the type of value it has assigned (use typeof) */

/* Create a new index27.js file

Define a firstNumber and secondNumber variables

Assign each variable a number type value

Code the following operations:

Adding both variables
Subtracting both variables
Multiplying both variables
Dividing both variables
Remainder from both variables
For each operation show the following output:

Example: I add 2 + 3 and the result is 5 (where 2 and 3 are firstNumber and secondNumber and 5 it's the operation result)
Use a template variable for each output and console.log() */
